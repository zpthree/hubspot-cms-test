## About the website
I made this website to play around with Hubspot CMS. I used HubDB to store all the data, and HubL to dynamically add data to the page.

Because the website was only built as a way to get assimilated with the Hubspot ecosystem, there wasn't really any thought put in to styling. The site is not responsive and it's not very pretty.

## Hubspot Config
To connect the app to hubspot you will need to create a ```hubspot.config.yml``` file. [Click here](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/local-development) to see an example of what that file will look like.
